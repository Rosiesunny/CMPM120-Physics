REQUIREMENTS:
The git commit history shows how the project continues starts empty and adds code over time.
- You can check the commit history!

The git commit history uses informative commit messages to describe what was changed at each step.
- Should be good

The game uses discrete inputs (button up/down state) and continuous inputs (mouse positions, button down duration etc.)
- to move from one level to the next, it is a discrete input (button up/down state), meanwhile continuous input is shown via the location of the basket and speed at which it goes is dependent on how long the button is held down

The player must use a physics-based interaction to achieve the goal in each core gameplay scene (e.g. get certain objects to collide)
- the froobs need to collide with the basket to gain points

The game contains 3+ distinct core gameplay scenes
- there are 3 levels

Additional scenes are inserted between core gameplay scenes to add context
- each level has a victory screen
